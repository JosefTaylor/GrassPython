##Convert Units##

A GH User object which converts units from SI to US Customary units.

##PulloutCones_AppD##

An ACI 318 Appendix D calculation for anchors in concrete. Like Hilti ProFis, but for weirder geometry.

##KangaNet##

Who knows what this is for.

##CenterLines##

Extracts centerlines from extrusion-ish objects. At the moment, only works on objects oriented to the global coordinate systems

##AreaTag##

Another stupid thing.
